Episode Types
=============

Episode handlers live in `controller/episode-handlers/ <https://github.com/georgysavva/mc-multiplayer-data/tree/release/controller/episode-handlers>`_. Episode type selection is
controlled via the ``EPISODE_TYPES`` environment variable:

- **Default**: if ``EPISODE_TYPES`` is unset (or set to ``all``), the controller samples
  from its built-in default list.
- **Custom list**: set ``EPISODE_TYPES`` to a comma-separated list of episode type
  strings, e.g. ``EPISODE_TYPES=walkLook,chase,pvp``.

Episode types are split into **Training** (default non-eval scenarios) and **Eval**
(episodes used for evaluation). Eval handlers live under `controller/episode-handlers/eval/ <https://github.com/georgysavva/mc-multiplayer-data/tree/release/controller/episode-handlers/eval>`_.

.. _adding-new-episode-type:

Adding a new episode type
-------------------------

To add a new episode type:

1. **Create the handler module** in `controller/episode-handlers/ <https://github.com/georgysavva/mc-multiplayer-data/tree/release/controller/episode-handlers>`_ (or
   `controller/episode-handlers/eval/ <https://github.com/georgysavva/mc-multiplayer-data/tree/release/controller/episode-handlers/eval>`_ for eval episodes). The module must export a
   class that extends :js:class:`episode-handlers.base-episode.BaseEpisode`.

2. **Register the episode in** `controller/episodes-loop.js <https://github.com/georgysavva/mc-multiplayer-data/tree/release/controller/episodes-loop.js>`_:
   - Add an entry to ``episodeClassMap`` mapping the episode type string (e.g. ``myNewEpisode``) to your class.
   - For eval episodes only: add your class to the ``evalEpisodeClasses`` array.
   - To include it in the default set when ``EPISODE_TYPES`` is unset, add the type string to ``defaultEpisodeTypes``.

3. **Add a typical length** in `controller/utils/episode-weights.js <https://github.com/georgysavva/mc-multiplayer-data/tree/release/controller/utils/episode-weights.js>`_: add your
   episode type key and a typical duration in seconds to ``episodeTypicalLengths``.
   This is used for weighted sampling (shorter episodes are sampled more often). If
   the type is missing, ``selectWeightedEpisodeType()`` will throw.
