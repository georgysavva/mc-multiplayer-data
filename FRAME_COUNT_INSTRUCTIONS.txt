FRAME COUNT LOGGING - SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

WHAT IT DOES:
- Automatically logs frame counts to: episode-handlers/frame_count_log.txt
- Format: structure_type,frame_count (one line per episode)

HOW TO USE:
1. Set the structure type in structureEval.js line 17:
   const ALL_STRUCTURE_TYPES = ["tower_2"];

2. Run 10 episodes:
   .\build_and_deploy_windows.ps1 -Build -ResetWorld
   (Make sure EPISODES_NUM is set to 10 in docker-compose-windows-fixed.yml)

3. Check the results:
   Open: episode-handlers\frame_count_log.txt
   
   Example output:
   tower_2,217
   tower_2,220
   tower_2,215
   ...

4. Repeat for other structure types:
   - Change line 17 to ["wall_2x2"]
   - Run again
   - Results append to same file

5. Clear the log when starting fresh:
   Delete episode-handlers\frame_count_log.txt

STRUCTURE TYPES AVAILABLE:
- tower_2
- wall_2x2
- wall_4x1
- platform_2x2

TARGET: 300 frames (15 seconds at 20 FPS)
